# Alô, Im Roger, from Rogerverso
As a UX Manager at Grupo Bandeirantes de Comunicação, I lead the UX team in creating innovative and user-centered solutions for Band.com and Bandplay projects. I use strategic design and lean inception tools and methodologies to deliver high-quality digital products and services.

I have over 14 years of design experience, working with large retail companies in Brazil and Latin America. I have developed strategic solutions for brand internationalization, customer engagement through new digital channels, and sales process optimization in the B2B sector.
